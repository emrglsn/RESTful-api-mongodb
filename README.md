# RESTful-api-mongodb

Simple RESTful API with MongoDB.

In this project, a RESTful API is provided to store the data of employees in MongoDB. The API is designed following the principles and structure of a RESTful API.

The Employees API allows users to perform basic operations such as listing, adding, updating, and deleting employee data. The API serves clients through structured endpoints over the HTTP protocol.
The data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the API interacts with this database to perform data operations. MongoDB's flexible document-based database model provides a user-friendly approach for storing employee data.
The RESTful API architecture is based on the idea of representing resources (in this case, employees) with unique URIs and using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on these resources. This API presents resources with user-friendly URIs and enables managing employee data by utilizing the relevant methods.
